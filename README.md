## How to Play

The game begins with four pieces on the board, two white and two black. Caputuring your opponent's pieces is like jumping pieces in checkers, except that you place one of your own pieces on one of the empty circles. Make a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of pieces so that your pieces surround the other player's pieces. This will capture the opponent's pieces and change them to your color, increasing both the number of your pieces on the board and your score. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

### Note:

You can only place your pieces on the board, one at a time, by capturing one of your opponent's pieces. If you cannot capture a piece, you will lose your turn.
